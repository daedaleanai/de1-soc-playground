Exposed push buttons
====================

This system implements the Hard Processor System with the push buttons exposed
at `0xff200000`. Follow the instructions in the master README file to install it
in the target board. The sw subdirectory contains a program that polls the
status of the buttons from the level of Linux userspace.
